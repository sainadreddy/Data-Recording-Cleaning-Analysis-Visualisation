# 
Data were collected using a blank form, then converted to electronic form, and merged into one using Python(code).The initial analysis contains comments inside the Jupyter notebook (code). After saving the merged file (attached in this repo), the following changes were made to conduct some additional analysis (Dashboards):

1. Removed all the columns that seemed unnecessary for this dashboard.
2. Changed all the genders to male or female instead of male,m, female,f.
3. Changed all transport types to Public or Private instead of yes, no, public, private.
   
You have slicers to filter the graphs representing the count of electric and non-electric vehicles, count of vehicles for each brand, percentage of electric and non-electric in each type of vehicle, public and private transport counts, and finally, a glimpse of male and female drivers.

>[Note]
> You can only view the percentage when one type of vehicle is selected.

Below are snap shots of 2 dashboards:
